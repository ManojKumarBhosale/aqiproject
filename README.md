# About the project Air Quality Index
The project basically a React SPA is a live dashboard for Air quality index for few cities (fetching data from url: ws://city-ws.herokuapp.com/)
and displays it in tabular format and charts.

It uses following npm packages :-
1. Ant Design for creating components like Table, Card and responsiveness etc.
2. styled-components for styling React components
3. apexcharts & react-apexcharts for creating charts (Since this is open source, good charts, decent interface, easy to use and also going to be partnered with FusionCharts.
   Other paid libraries like HighCharts and canvas.js were also good options from performance point of view. But to reduce exploration time I have used Apex Charts).
